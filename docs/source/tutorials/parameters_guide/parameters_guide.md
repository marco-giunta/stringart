# Detailed parameter description
There are two types of parameters you can set in *StringArt*.
- *base parameters*: parameters that you (may) need to tweak yourself, even when default values are provided - so please read this section carefully!
- *advanced parameters*: parameters that you can ignore, as they control technical parts of the algorithm that you probably have no reason to interact with. These parameters are left here mostly for debugging reason, but feel free to read about them and modify their values if you want more control over what the algorithm does.

For each parameter you can find in parentheses the name of the corresponding API/CLI variable. Notice that some parameters don't have a perfect 1:1 mapping between the API and the CLI, either because of a slightly different parametrization or because the CLI implements functionality from multiple API functions.
